User voice input (input audio stream as 1 channel, 44100 Hz, 16 bit depth per sample)
 -> continuously extract byte stream frames
  -> convert frames to text in real time (natural language processing neural net parallel calls)
   -> detect intent from continuous input text and structure as json payload (intent classification neural net)
    -> handle request (generating text response and any handling of api calls if needed)
     -> response text converted to byte stream
      -> output response over speakers (output audio stream)

Input byte stream -> capabilities to convert frames to decimal and then use samples to continuously:
- plot time series graph
- plot frequency domain graph
- average out frequency domain impulses and create 3D ball spikes vibration effect
